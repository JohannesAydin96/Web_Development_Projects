# Web Development Projects

This repository contains two separate projects developed while learning and practicing **web development with different technologies**.  
Both projects explore core concepts like user authentication, database interaction, and multi-layered architecture.

## Projects
- [Java Webshop](./Java_Webshop)  
  A simple webshop built with Java, JSP, and JDBC running on Apache Tomcat.  
  Features include a shopping basket, user login, and basic item management.

- [ASP.NET MVC Auction System](./ASPNet_Auction)  
  A simplified auction system built with ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework.  
  Users can register, create auctions, place bids, and view auctions they have won.

## Background
The goal of these projects was to strengthen my understanding of **full-stack web development** by working with two different frameworks:  
- **Java + JSP/Servlets (Tomcat)** for server-side rendering and database access.  
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** for modern .NET web application development with Entity Framework and Identity.  

Both projects follow a **three-layer architecture**, ensuring a clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data.
